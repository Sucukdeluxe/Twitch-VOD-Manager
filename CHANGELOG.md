# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 1.0.34 - 2026-10-11

This patch makes Windows updates from older Twitch VOD Manager releases reliable on GitHub release assets.

### Updater

- Disable multipart range requests for GitHub release assets, which can reject differential updater requests.
- Use the release directory URL with an explicit trailing slash for deterministic metadata and installer resolution.
- Keep the updater on the verified full installer path for unsigned Windows releases.

### Verification

- The real packaged 1.0.32 to 1.0.33 updater path downloaded and SHA-512 verified the installer.
- The new packaged updater path is verified against the public release assets before publishing.
- The Windows installer remains unsigned, as in previous releases.

## 1.0.33 - 2026-10-11

This patch makes Twitch's hidden Source renditions available for VOD quality selection and download.

### VOD Source quality

- Detect Twitch `unavailable-media` renditions such as 1440p60 HEVC that are hidden from the regular Streamlink quality list.
- Show the actual Source resolution, frame rate and codec in the quality dialog.
- Download Source and explicitly selected high-resolution renditions through the direct Twitch HLS manifest when available, while keeping standard 1080p and lower qualities on the existing Streamlink path.
- Use the same high-resolution Source path for VOD preview playback.

### Verification

- 959 unit tests, build, ESLint and headless VOD/player audits passed.
- VOD 2897060167 verified as a 2560×1440 HEVC 60 fps Source stream through the real HLS path.
- Windows installer remains unsigned, as in previous releases.

## 1.0.32 - 2026-10-10

This patch fixes category selection in the VOD trimming workflow so a selected Twitch chapter is downloaded as the requested range only.

### VOD chapter trimming

- Make “Kategorie zuschneiden” select the chapter as the download excerpt in every editing mode.
- Leave “Bereiche auslassen” when a chapter is selected instead of treating the chapter as content to exclude.
- Preserve exact chapter start and end boundaries in the queue plan, preventing preceding categories from being downloaded accidentally.

### Verification

- 959 unit tests and the release checks passed.
- A deterministic four-hour VOD regression check confirms that a chapter from 03:00:00 to 04:00:00 produces exactly one 03:00:00–04:00:00 download range.
- The Windows installer is unsigned, as in previous releases.

## 1.0.31 - 2026-10-10

- Reorder waiting exports while retaining keyboard focus, remove saved jobs together without deleting files, and see numeric progress.
- Show VOD frame rates and available codec metadata. Repeated quality lookups are cached briefly.
- Preview discovered clips with the shared player and view their duration before downloading.
- Search saved projects by project or source name and sort by date or name.
- Use a supported frame size when detecting hardware encoders, avoiding false negatives on NVIDIA and Intel GPUs.
- Keep shared player menus in the active dialog so clip preview controls stay visible.\r\n\r\n## 1.0.30 - 2026-10-10

This update adds per-VOD quality selection and fixes five interface issues in the video editor, export queue, clip search and statistics.

### VOD quality

- Choose the download quality before adding an individual VOD to the queue or opening it for trimming. Source is selected by default.
- The dialog lists the qualities actually available for that VOD, including 1440p when Twitch provides it. H.264, HEVC and AV1 variants are recognized; availability depends on the recording.
- The chosen quality is retained in the queue, after restarting the app and when downloading or merging parts. An explicitly chosen quality is not silently replaced with another one.
- Failed quality lookups can be retried, and the dialog can be cancelled without adding a download. Bulk and automatic downloads continue to use Source.

### Video editor and export queue

- The timeline and playback controls retain the space they need instead of being cut off when the window is shorter or export jobs are present.
- The editing page can scroll to the cut fields and export jobs. The last job remains reachable in a longer queue.
- Queue export is now visible beside Merge in the merge workspace. Its availability follows the selected files and current operation. Queuing an export and starting it immediately remain separate actions.

### Clip search

- Changing the channel or date range clears results, selections and pagination from the previous search.
- A failed new search can no longer leave clips from another channel available for import or pagination.
- Late responses cannot overwrite a newer search. Closing and reopening the dialog during a search leaves the controls usable.
- A failed request for the next page preserves the matching results already loaded.

### Statistics and interface

- Activity chart tooltips show the complete date range, including the year, when a bar combines several days. The total is no longer attributed to a single day.
- The Update button is vertically centered in the top bar, with consistent text size and spacing.

### Verification

- 949 unit tests and 42 additional checks passed, covering Chromium, WebKit and the native Electron app.
- Targeted checks covered 188 layout states, 88 interaction cases and nine native layout cases. Existing checks also covered editing, queues, project recovery, backups, archive operations and real audio/HDR exports.

The Windows installer is unsigned, as with previous releases.

## 1.0.29 - 2026-10-10

This update fixes an overlapping preview in the video editor that could cover the project name and project actions.

### Video editor

- The project toolbar keeps its full height instead of collapsing beneath the preview.
- The empty preview is centered and sized to fit the available window height while retaining its 16:9 aspect ratio.
- The loaded editing workspace continues to use its flexible layout.

## 1.0.28 - 2026-10-10

This update adds reusable editing projects, a persistent export queue, full application backups, and more precise control over source formats, audio and automated downloads. It also expands the archive, download history and clip browser.

### Video editing and export

- Save named editing projects, create independent variants and reopen recent projects. Projects retain the selected excerpt, omitted ranges, export settings and audio options.
- Move a project together with its source video, or locate a moved source again. File contents are checked before the project is linked to a replacement. Projects and source videos can be stored on different drives.
- Queue video cuts and merges. Export jobs survive restarts and support pause, cancellation and retry. An interrupted export is identified instead of being silently run again.
- Export retains the selected source bit depth and color format where supported. HDR sources no longer silently become 8-bit SDR; explicit SDR conversion is available. The archive profile preserves decoded video and audio without lossy encoding.
- Export all audio tracks or select an individual track. Optional fades and loudness normalization apply to the exported audio.
- A live audio meter shows the preview signal in the local video editor.
- Merging checks codec, resolution, frame rate, color format and audio tracks first. Matching files can keep their original streams; incompatible files require an explicit supported conversion.
- More specific file and export errors explain the next action, with technical details available separately.

### Backups and storage

- Back up settings, the current download queue, download history, editing workspaces, saved projects, export jobs and VOD library entries in one file. Source videos and credentials are not included.
- Preview a backup before restoring it. Restoration validates the data, keeps a safety copy and pauses automation. Saved project documents are restored as separate copies without overwriting their original locations.
- A manual backup includes the current queue even when automatic queue persistence is disabled.
- Storage cleanup runs asynchronously and shows the files to be affected before applying the operation. Files changed after the preview are skipped. Matching chat and event files are handled with their video.
- Archive changes update an incremental index; explicit refreshes and periodic reconciliation still check the full folder.

### Archive, history and statistics

- Filter archive results by date and send selected videos directly to the editor or merge workspace.
- Browse persistent download history by date, type, channel or title, and export it as CSV. Deleting a downloaded file does not erase its history.
- Select time ranges for statistics and export the corresponding download data.

### VODs, clips and automation

- Save VOD filter views and streamer groups for reuse.
- Save timeline markers and complete excerpts, including their omitted ranges, and apply them again.
- Browse a channel’s clips by date and add selected clips to the batch downloader. Previously downloaded clips are identified.
- Set title, duration and age rules per channel for automatic VOD downloads. Preview matching VODs before saving a rule.

### Interface and release checks

- Centered, scroll-bounded project, library and clip dialogs use consistent controls and readable spacing in both themes. Less frequently used download settings are grouped in expandable sections.
- Release packages include only the current renderer assets. Obsolete hashed build files are excluded.
- Publishing now requires a complete local verification record, a matching source fingerprint and a native check of the packaged application. A CI build alone does not count as a verified release.

This Windows release is unsigned, as with previous releases.

## 1.0.27 - 2026-10-09

This update fixes six issues in storage analysis and streamer management.

### Storage

- Large download folders are scanned without blocking the application. In the verified 10,005-file test, the longest main-process pause fell from over 500 ms to under 10 ms.
- Files directly in the download folder are included in file counts and storage totals.
- Chat files in nested folders are included in chat storage totals.
- The storage table stays inside its settings card. Long folder names wrap, and narrow layouts can scroll horizontally without covering nearby controls.
- File counts follow the selected language, including thousands separators.

### Streamer management

- Adding a streamer can be retried after a failed save. The input and previous list are preserved until saving succeeds.
- Removing and reordering streamers use the same recovery behavior. Concurrent list changes are saved in order, and text entered during a pending save is preserved.

### Verification

- 847 automated tests and 20 browser test runs passed, with additional checks in Chromium and WebKit for long names, narrow layouts and failed-save recovery.
- Native checks covered download cancellation, reload and restart recovery, video merging and export.

## 1.0.26 - 2026-10-09

This update removes startup stalls, keeps large download queues responsive, and restores clip and merge workspaces after reopening the app. It also improves error recovery, archive browsing and the video editor.

### Startup and responsiveness

- Tool discovery and Streamlink, FFmpeg and FFprobe checks run asynchronously instead of blocking the main process. Simultaneous checks share their work and have time limits.
- The window appears after the interface has initialized. Navigation and keyboard controls no longer wait for Twitch login or initial network requests.
- Old preview files are cleaned up in the background, while temporary files belonging to an active editor are preserved.
- Large queues update changed rows instead of rebuilding the entire list. Collapsed details are created when opened, reducing startup and update work.

### Download queue

- Changes to titles, dates, durations and output files appear reliably, including updates that do not change download progress.
- Starting a download immediately updates its visible status, progress information and drag availability.
- Removing selected entries updates their selection numbers correctly. The merge action disappears when the queue or eligible selection is empty.
- Unchanged rows remain in place during updates and reordering, preserving their controls and reducing visual disruption.

### Twitch Clips

- Clip lists, metadata and download states are saved and restored. A running download reconnects to the interface after a renderer reload.
- Metadata requests interrupted by a reload restart correctly instead of leaving clips stuck in the loading state.
- Cancel the current clip during preparation, transfer or final saving. Partial files and child processes are cleaned up when cancellation completes.
- Active transfers show downloaded data and speed. Individual clips can be removed, and saved clips can be opened or shown in their folder.
- Saved filenames preserve umlauts and other valid Unicode characters while excluding characters Windows cannot use.
- Missing clips and temporary metadata failures have distinct states. Retry and completion updates no longer rebuild every row in a large batch.

### Joining videos

- Selected files, their order and durations are restored after restarting. Missing files are identified before a merge starts.
- Reorder files with the drag handle or the existing move actions. The workspace shows individual and total durations.
- Failed file selection, output selection or merge requests release the controls so the operation can be retried. Rapid duplicate clicks do not start overlapping operations.
- Retrying after an invalid or protected output location keeps access to the original input files.

### Archive and video editor

- Browse archive results in pages instead of being limited to the first 200 matches. Filter changes return to the first page, and late responses cannot replace a newer search.
- Repeated archive queries reuse a short-lived inventory. Explicit refreshes and completed downloads update the inventory when needed.
- Failed page changes keep the last successful results and allow another attempt.
- The local editor has a more compact file header and more readable controls. Timeline labels remain visible below the audio waveform, including compact layouts.
- VOD cards show two-line titles. Top workspace actions are aligned consistently to the right, and file sizes follow the selected language.

### Settings and automation

- Failed setting changes display a persistent retry action. New edits made while a save is in progress are saved afterwards instead of being lost.
- Theme, language and download-folder changes use the same save and recovery flow.
- Auto-VOD and live-recording scans distinguish provider failures from a successful scan with no new videos or live channels. Automation status is localized.
- Diagnostics refresh only while their relevant section is visible. A successful log request restores the output after an earlier failure, even if the log content has not changed.
- Redundant descriptions and duplicate headings have been reduced; diagnostics are collapsible and fixed Source quality is shown directly.

### Development builds

- Stylesheet changes update the running interface without restarting playback or clearing editor state. Invalid styles leave the last valid appearance in place.
- Changes to application logic still require a restart and are identified separately by the development status indicator.

### Verification

- The changes were checked with 841 automated tests, Chromium and WebKit interface suites, and 1,000 queue combination steps.
- Additional checks covered isolated startup stress, clip cancellation, Unicode output, reload recovery, real video merging and cutter export. These checks do not imply compatibility with every codec, device or network condition.

## 1.0.25 - 2026-10-09

This update rebuilds Twitch Clips for batch downloads, preserves download statistics when files are removed, and simplifies navigation and settings. Twitch downloads and previews now consistently use Source quality.

### Twitch Clips for single links and large batches

- Paste up to 200 Twitch clip links, one per line, into a centered workspace. The separate Clips sidebar and duplicate toolbar have been removed.
- Clip titles and streamer names load as links are added. The list shows the actual clip information instead of the URL identifier, before a download starts.
- Both Twitch clip URL formats are supported, including links with additional query parameters. Duplicate links to the same clip are recognized even when their URL format differs.
- Public clip lookup works without a connected Twitch account. Missing clips and connection failures are handled separately instead of reporting every lookup problem as “Clip not found.”
- Each entry shows its download state. Failed clips can be retried without downloading successful entries again; stopping a batch finishes the current clip and leaves the remaining entries available to continue.
- A new loading indicator and green completion icon make states easier to distinguish. Updating progress or clip information preserves existing rows and their animations.
- The input area, results list and surrounding controls stay in place as clips are added. Long lists scroll internally, and existing text and icons no longer shift when a separator or scrollbar appears.
- Messages appear without moving the workspace and disappear after five seconds. Completion messages use the correct singular or plural and omit unnecessary zero counts.

### Download statistics that remain available

- VOD, clip and live-recording totals are stored independently of the files currently in the download folder. Removing a video or clearing completed queue entries no longer resets those totals.
- The redesigned Statistics page separates completed downloads and downloaded data from the current folder contents.
- Review activity over the last 30 days, storage by streamer and the size distribution of archived videos. Counts follow the selected interface language.
- Previously saved completed queue entries are included where available. Downloads deleted before a completion record was stored cannot be reconstructed.
- Refresh errors preserve the last available figures and show the relevant status in place.

### A clearer archive

- Archive search uses the full workspace without a redundant sidebar. Search, recording type, streamer and sorting controls are grouped above the results.
- Clip files are assigned to their streamer correctly, and available streamer filters come from the current file inventory.
- Folder scanning runs in the background. Rapid changes to a search keep the latest results, while longer result lists scroll inside a stable area.
- File actions and matching chat or event files remain accessible from each recording.

### Source quality throughout Twitch downloads

- Full VODs, selected VOD ranges, parts, live recordings, clips and the VOD player request Source quality.
- Older saved or imported quality preferences are updated to Source automatically. The setting now displays the fixed quality directly.

### Navigation and VOD controls

- The active navigation tab fills the height of the bar. Labels scale for wider windows, and tab changes use a short fade instead of a sliding selection bar.
- The Streamer and Queue headings, counters and empty states have matching spacing. Streamer entry and title-filter fields use more compact widths.
- Streamer actions are grouped consistently, with a green add button and a single refresh action. The Twitch profile link has a purple button with recognizable icons.
- Sorting controls have visible dropdown arrows, the downloaded filter has clearer contrast, and unwanted click outlines and the bulk-selection tooltip have been removed.
- The merge workspace is centered in the available area. Clips, Statistics and Archive no longer show unnecessary context sidebars.

### Settings with fewer sections

- Settings are grouped into General, Twitch API, Downloads, Automation, Storage & Backup, and System & Diagnostics. Appearance and updates are part of General.
- Shorter labels, more readable text and compact number fields reduce wasted space. Auto-VOD interval and age fields line up with their action buttons.
- Language selection opens in its saved position without an initial slide. Theme controls keep their smooth selection transition.
- System status is easier to read in both themes. Redundant explanatory blocks and permanent success messages have been removed across the application.

### Faster, more reliable development startup

- Verified development builds are reused instead of rebuilding every time the app opens. Changed or incomplete builds are still rebuilt before launch.
- Startup preparation is serialized, duplicate development instances are prevented, and the window is shown after its first render.
- Development builds identify themselves in the window title and application header.

### Verification and distribution

- Validation covers both interface languages, light and dark themes, different window sizes, 200-clip batches, rapid add/remove sequences and preservation of download history after file removal.
- The Windows release includes the installer, blockmap and update metadata for the integrated updater.

## 1.0.24 - 2026-10-09

- Improve frame-accurate VOD trimming with immediate playback controls, current-position omission preview and visible excluded ranges in fine seeking.
- Support multiple non-overlapping exclusions while keeping output parts at the configured length and preserving skipped original part numbers.
- Refine the local cutter with sharper high-resolution audio waveforms, persistent export-profile selection, shared I/O controls and clearer trim-mode icons.
- Clean up the VOD history and omission workspace with a single title presentation, clearer active-history state, compact controls and more readable output summaries.

- Synchronize local cutter time displays with presented video frames, fix adjacent-frame seeking and fractional-rate timecode round-trips, and show frame labels when zoomed. Keep thumbnail widths uniform and render separate audio-channel peaks sharply at the current zoom.

- Reuse the VOD trimming I/O markers and fine-seek preview in the local cutter, replacing duplicate marker rendering and input handling while preserving frame-aligned edits and undo/redo.

- Compact the local cutter export and selection panels, show readable audio-track choices and keep exclusions visible in both edit modes. Route Space to playback after control clicks, suppress control focus rings and Tab traversal outside editable fields, and reset progress for each export.

- Fix broken cutter loading and misplaced navigation after source changes by loading a complete renderer build. Keep single-start development sessions stable and rebuild all assets before restarting watch sessions.

- Rework the local Video Cutter around shared player controls, one thumbnail/waveform timeline, visible excerpt markers, confirmed exclusion edits and a compact export sidebar. Preserve frame stepping, project recovery and undo/redo; improve keyboard boundaries, fine dragging and scrub completion.

- Add the Streamrecorder history sidebar with Twitch game chapters, covers, category filters, direct seeking and one-click selection of a category for trimming. Show VOD time, original date/time, category and available title history when hovering over the player timeline.
- Read matching title-change events from local live-recording logs. Keep the stored VOD title separate when a historical title timeline is unavailable.

- Rebuild VOD trimming around the full Streamrecorder video player, including continuous HLS playback, seeking across the complete VOD, fine seeking, exact timestamps, speed, volume, keyboard controls, cinema mode, fullscreen and picture-in-picture.
- Add draggable start/end markers, I/O shortcuts, selection playback and precise cut-time inputs in a responsive workspace. Keep filename and continuation settings together in the sidebar.
- Fetch only the VOD segments needed for playback through a restricted local media endpoint and stop pending requests when the dialog closes.
- Finalize VOD, trim, live and clip downloads as verified MP4 containers using stream copy, preserving the selected video and audio quality instead of saving raw stream data under an MP4 extension.
- Explain the difference between downloads without re-encoding and re-encoded local video-cutter exports.
- Keep project memory, tests, fixtures and test artifacts local; allow build and packaging from checkouts without local test files.

## 1.0.23 - 2026-09-07

- Start pending downloads in the visible queue order, including manually reordered entries. Retire the automatic short-job prioritization, including for existing configurations.

## 1.0.22 - 2026-09-06

- Show small round profile pictures beside streamer names in the sidebar, with an initial fallback when an image is unavailable.

## 1.0.21 - 2026-09-06

- Show the Twitch display name with its original capitalization in queue details and refresh it when profile names load.
- Put queue detail URLs on a separate single line; click or use the keyboard to copy the complete URL with confirmation.
- Keep queue-card titles and content aligned when expanding or collapsing details by reserving scrollbar space.
- Move the queue-card remove button slightly toward the top-right corner while retaining its 32-pixel click target.
- Show a yellow left border on waiting queue cards, matching their status dot.
- Place the queue-card date on the left beside the details arrow and the download status on the right below the progress bar.

## 1.0.20 - 2026-09-06

- Fix automatic media-tool setup in long Windows paths by using the built-in archive extractor. Report extraction failures instead of accepting incomplete installations.
- Make queue cards easier to read with two-line titles, larger dates below the progress bar on the right, and 32-pixel remove and retry buttons.
- Show clearer download states, preserve the progress percentage while paused, and wrap long error messages. Keep the waiting status simple with a yellow dot and no badge background or outline.
- Open and close download details by double-clicking the card surface or using the dedicated keyboard-accessible arrow.
- Animate details smoothly in both directions with a matching arrow rotation. Respond immediately to rapid clicks and keep collapsed file actions out of keyboard navigation.
- Fix the Windows hot-development startup crash caused by looking for the application icon in the packaged resource directory.
- Add isolated queue-card checks for both languages and themes, keyboard controls, animation and rapid clicks; exclude local development data and bundled third-party tools from linting.

## 1.0.19 - 2026-08-14

- Provision managed Streamlink and FFmpeg automatically in the background after installation so first downloads start without tool setup delays.
- Show a dedicated "Preparing download tools" status in the queue while download tools are checked or installed before a download begins.

## 1.0.18 - 2026-08-14

- Install managed Streamlink and FFmpeg successfully on systems whose PowerShell only ships the built-in archive tooling.

- Improve the video cutter with accessible new, open and save actions, unambiguous frame timecodes, multi-audio exports and verified VFR, AV1, HEVC, MKV, TS and AVI handling.
- Make streamer switching, multi-selection and bulk queue operations race-safe while preserving failed selections for retry.
- Keep queue status, progress, health, speed and remaining time accurate across pause, retry, completion and live recording changes.
- Harden sensitive configuration migration, provider error redaction, process shutdown, crash recovery and Windows installer upgrades.
- Add isolated validation for managed media tools, supported cutter media, Windows installation modes, Twitch provider access and published updater downloads.

## 1.0.17 - 2026-08-13

- Keep the loaded video cutter focused at every supported window size and give recovery notices their own layout space.
- Preserve recovered hardware encoder selections until export capabilities finish loading, and reject unsupported cutter files without changing the current project.
- Follow the Windows color scheme when the System theme is selected.
- Fully localize Runtime Metrics in German, including values, counts and error classes.

- Prevent Auto-Cleanup options from being clipped.
- Increase primary navigation label size and improve inactive-label contrast.

## 1.0.14 - 2026-08-12

- Provision the Electron binary with a bounded retry before Windows CI smoke tests.

## 1.0.13 - 2026-08-12

- Apply the Windows CI retry to both directory and installer packaging.

## 1.0.12 - 2026-08-12

- Retry transient Electron download failures once while packaging on Windows CI.

## 1.0.11 - 2026-08-12
