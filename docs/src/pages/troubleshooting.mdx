# Troubleshooting

## "Keine VODs" after adding streamer

1. Ensure the streamer exists and has archive VODs.
2. Press **Aktualisieren**.
3. If you use credentials, re-save `Client ID` + `Client Secret` in **Einstellungen**.
4. Check bottom status bar:
   - `Verbunden` in authenticated mode
   - `Ohne Login (Public Modus)` in credential-free mode

The app retries auth automatically on expired tokens and can continue in public mode without credentials.

## "Streamer nicht gefunden"

- Use login name only (no URL, no `@`).
- Names are normalized to lowercase.
- Verify streamer spelling directly on Twitch.

## Clip/Cutter/Merge duration shows 0 or preview fails

Usually caused by broken `ffprobe` detection.

Check:

```bash
ffprobe -version
```

If missing, install FFmpeg package that includes `ffprobe` and restart app.

## "Streamlink not found"

Install streamlink and verify:

```bash
streamlink --version
```

Then restart the app.

## Auto-update does not trigger

Release must include all of:

- `latest.yml`
- `Twitch-VOD-Manager-Setup-<version>.exe`
- `Twitch-VOD-Manager-Setup-<version>.exe.blockmap`

Tag version must match app version (example: `v3.7.6`).
