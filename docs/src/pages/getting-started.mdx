# Getting Started

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (installer and paths are currently Windows-first)
- `streamlink` available in `PATH`
- `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe` available in `PATH`

Optional but recommended:

- Twitch API app with `Client ID` and `Client Secret` (for authenticated Helix mode)

## Install

1. Download the latest setup from GitHub Releases.
2. Run `Twitch-VOD-Manager-Setup-<version>.exe`.
3. Launch the app.

## First-Time Setup

1. Open **Einstellungen**.
2. Choose your download path.
3. Optional: enter `Client ID` and `Client Secret` for authenticated mode.
4. Click **Speichern & Verbinden**.
5. Add a streamer in the header input and press `+`.

If everything is correct, VOD cards appear.

- With credentials: status is `Verbunden`.
- Without credentials: status shows `Ohne Login (Public Modus)` and VOD downloads still work.

## Verify Tools

In PowerShell or CMD:

```bash
streamlink --version
ffmpeg -version
ffprobe -version
```

If one command fails, install the missing tool and restart the app.
