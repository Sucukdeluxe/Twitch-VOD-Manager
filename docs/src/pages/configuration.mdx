# Configuration

## File Locations

The app stores runtime data in:

`C:\ProgramData\Twitch_VOD_Manager`

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `config.json` | User settings and Twitch credentials |
| `download_queue.json` | Persistent download queue state |

Default download path:

`%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\Twitch_VODs`

## Main Config Keys

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `client_id` | Twitch application client id |
| `client_secret` | Twitch application client secret |
| `download_path` | Base output folder |
| `streamers` | Sidebar streamer list |
| `theme` | UI theme (`twitch`, `discord`, `youtube`, `apple`) |
| `download_mode` | Full VOD or parts mode |
| `part_minutes` | Split length in minutes for parts mode |

## Notes

- Credentials are optional. If empty, the app uses public mode for streamer/VOD discovery.
- Credentials are currently stored in plain text config file.
- The app trims credential fields before saving to reduce whitespace issues.
- Legacy keys can exist in config from older versions; unknown keys are ignored.
